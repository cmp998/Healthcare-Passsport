            Our goal is to empower people with their own data. Your healthcare passport is a record of past doctors visits of any kind,
             current medications, allergens, shot records, and anything related to your healthcare record. Our vision is to increase the transparency
             of medical records for ones' self, allowing patients to have a centralized location for all of their health related records.
